CSCI 356 Fall 2024 Project 4 Starter Code
-----------------------------------------

This repository contains starter code for project 4, adventures in semi-reliable
protocol design.

* `server.py` - Implements the server half of the example protocols.
* `client_saw.py` - (example) Client half for a stop-and-wait protocol.
* `client_burst1.py` - (example) Client half for a burst-oriented protocol.
* `client_burst2.py` - (example) Nearly the same.
* `client_pipelined.py` - (example) Client half for a sliding window protocol.

Tasks:

- [ ] Rent a cloud machine, i.e. "create an instance in Google Compute Engine"
- [ ] Install python code on a few cloud machines.
- [ ] Test stop-and-wait, burst-oriented, and pipelined example protocols.
- [ ] Design, implement, and test a better protocol.
- [ ] Write a report documenting findings.
